C++ File build process:(Source code to executable file)

Source code[test.cpp]->preprossesor->[test.ii]->Compiler->[test.s]->Assembler->[test.o]->Linker->[test.exe]->Loader->Load File in Ram->Execution


Commands for compilation/linking/execution through CLI:

One liner for whole file build process:

g++ test.cpp  // compilation done and a.exe file will be created
./a.exe    // executing and output is shown         ./ is for PWD


Each step from compiling to assembling and linking:

g++ -S test.cpp  // Compilation done only, test.s file will be created after compilation and it contains intermediate code

g++ -c test.cpp  // Asembling done only, test.o file will be created will be in proper machine code

g++ -o test.exe test.cpp  // Linking test.o files and library code to convert into executable file. test.exe file will be created
